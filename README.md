## About

I design and implement end-to-end systems that operate beyond prototypes — systems that survive scale, operational complexity, and failure.

My background spans enterprise engineering and startup execution, shaping how I approach software: architecture first, technology second.

Today my work centers on applied AI, system design, and operational infrastructure — building cohesive systems across backend, data, cloud, and AI layers.

Because deploying a model is easy.  
Designing a system that remains stable under growth is not.

## Current Focus

### Zenet

I’m building **Zenet**, a modular operational system for the restaurant industry.

The objective is structural standardization before automation:

- Designing decision layers  
- Aligning workflows  
- Creating reliable data pipelines  
- Integrating AI into stable operational architecture  
- Building scalable, long-term infrastructure  

Zenet is designed as a system — not a feature-driven product.

## Technical Areas

- AI & LLM integration (frontier and open-source models)
- Agentic workflows & orchestration systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Machine learning in production environments
- End-to-end system implementation (backend, cloud, data, AI layers)
- System observability & lifecycle design

## Engineering Principles

- Architecture before optimization  
- Constraints before features  
- Observability before scale  
- Systems over isolated solutions  

Complex systems don’t fail randomly — they fail structurally.
